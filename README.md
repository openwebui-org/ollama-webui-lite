## About This Fork

This repository represents a previous version of OpenWebUI, maintained to provide a simplified user interface with essential features and reduced complexity. Our focus is on maintaining a lean, efficient, and user-friendly experience.

## Philosophy

Unlike the feature-rich approach of OpenWebUI.com, this fork is committed to maintaining a minimalist design. We believe in the power of simplicity and aim to provide a straightforward, efficient interface for interacting with Ollama models.
